# About the author

Claus Gaarde Pedersen  

I work as a mainframe developer for KMD a danish company, where i work in the department, providing systems for the danish tax office, specifically systems for real estate evaluation.  
During my work i often have to extract, manipulate and present data to our customers. To better myself in this aspect i searched for an advanced excel course and while searching discovered the world of MOOCs. Which quickly led to this Data Science Specialization, which i immediately knew was the thing i wanted to study.  
Now at the end of the specialization i can conclude that it has been a big success for me, not just because i have completed all these courses that i can put on my resume, but mostly it has given me alot of energy to use the tools introduced during the courses to relatively easy create something that can be presented for a wide audience. 

The subject i have mostly been interested in, is to present data on an interactive map. For this leaflet has been a blessing for me. Some examples can be seen here :  

My wife wanted help to do some analysation based on hofstede cultural scores. I thought, lets put those scores on a map, and started working in Rstudio to make this  
[Hofstede cultural scores](http://rpubs.com/clausgp/hofstede)  
Not really what the wife wanted, but what can you do, when you are obsessed about creating interactive maps!

Another example where i try to combine 2 leaflet maps, that work interactively is :  
[Foreign recidencies in Denmark by municipality](https://khlavus.shinyapps.io/komrecidency/)  
This works best on a wide screen.
